        "answer": "For an immunocompetent adult with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma confined to the brain, the treatment plan consists of:\n\nInduction Phase: Initiate high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy, as this is the mainstay of induction for primary CNS lymphoma. Combine with rituximab, the primary immunotherapy agent, to enhance response. Consider adding agents such as temozolomide or vincristine as per protocol and patient tolerance. Supportive corticosteroids may be used to reduce cerebral edema and symptoms.\n\nConsolidation Phase: Upon achieving remission or maximal response, proceed to consolidation with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), which is the most commonly used radiation technique in this context. Alternatively, high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue may be considered based on patient performance status and institutional protocols.\n\nThroughout treatment, provide supportive care to manage symptoms and treatment side effects, involving a multidisciplinary team as needed.

Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a rare cancer that starts in certain white blood cells (B lymphocytes) and affects the skin.

CBCL often appears as lumps (nodules) or small bumps (papules) on the skin. These may be painless and grow slowly.\n\nHow is it diagnosed? Your doctor will examine your skin and may order blood tests and imaging scans. The most important step is a skin biopsy, where a small piece of skin is removed and studied. Special laboratory tests (immunophenotyping) and checks for genetic changes help confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of lymphoma.\n\nWhy is follow-up important? Most CBCLs grow slowly, but it is important to monitor your condition regularly to catch any changes early. Your healthcare team will guide you through treatment and follow-up visits.\n\nIf you notice new skin lumps or changes, let your doctor know promptly.",

Genetic tests revealed an FGFR3 mutation, which my oncologist explained could influence my treatment options.\n\nCurrently, I'm receiving systemic therapy, which includes cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. My doctor also discussed targeted therapies such as erdafitinib because of my FGFR3 mutation. The treatments have caused fatigue, nausea, and some urinary incontinence, but supportive care services have helped manage these side effects.\n\nMy care team emphasizes the importance of regular imaging and lab tests for surveillance, as well as considering clinical trials for new therapies.

        "answer": "For a patient with newly diagnosed Stage II anal squamous cell carcinoma, the diagnostic workup should start with a digital rectal exam (DRE) and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) to evaluate the primary lesion and surrounding tissues.

Summarize the diagnostic workup, relevant biomarkers, and outline the initial treatment plan for the receiving multidisciplinary team.",
        "answer": "Dear Multidisciplinary Team,\n\nI am referring a 45-year-old female patient recently diagnosed with Stage II invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Diagnostic workup included mammogram and ultrasound, which revealed a suspicious lesion; MRI confirmed tumor extent. Core needle biopsy established the diagnosis and provided tissue for biomarker assessment, which demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity, and HER2 negativity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy identified limited nodal involvement, consistent with Stage II disease. Blood tests were unremarkable.\n\nGiven the hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative profile, the initial treatment plan includes breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy), followed by radiation therapy. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor) is planned. Chemotherapy will be considered based on tumor grade and patient risk factors. The patient will be evaluated by fertility preservation specialists prior to systemic therapy, and performance status will be closely monitored throughout treatment.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Smith",
