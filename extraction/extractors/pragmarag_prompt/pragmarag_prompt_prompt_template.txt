Your task is to extract a set of structured facts from the input document in the form of entities and their relationships. You will be guided by a high-level conceptual schema (list of entity types and relation types), which reflects the types of information that are generally important to capture. However, this schema is only a reference â€” do not try to reproduce it mechanically. Instead, use it to develop an intuition for which concepts and relationships are important.

-Be faithful to the input text. Avoid hallucinating information not clearly stated or implied. Your extractions must be grounded in the content provided.

-Goal-

Given a text document and a list of entity types and relation types derived from a previous abstraction phase, extract from the document:

1. All relevant entities of the given types, or of similar types that align conceptually.
2. All meaningful relationships between those entities, based on the evidence in the text.

-Steps-

1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following or similar types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Concise but complete description of the entity as grounded in the text

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly and explicitly related to each other based on the content.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation_description: explanation based strictly on the input text of why these entities are related
- relationship_key
